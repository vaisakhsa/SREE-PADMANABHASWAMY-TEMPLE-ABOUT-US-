					<h2><b>HISTORY</b></h2>
					<p><b>The "Methan Mani" is located near the Padmanabha Swamy Temple in Thiruvananthapuram. To see it, one has to stand before the temple entrance and look in the opposite direction of the Padmatheertha pond. It is on the top of the Old Fort Palace. The unique feature of the clock is the presence of a bearded man on top of the dial who opens his mouth corresponding to every hour and two rams hit his cheek and forcing him to close his mouth. This action is co-oridnated with the hourly chimes.
It is said to have been installed in the 1840s during the reign of Maharaja Swathi Thirunal Rama Varma. The clock is constructed from Mahogany by an artisan called Kulathooran. Records show that two clockwork mechanisms were purchased by the then State of Travancore from Chennai. One was installed at Trivandrum, the other at Padmanabhapuram Palace, in Tamil Nadu.
The clock works perfectly, and strikes each hour in a day. The Methan Mani remains a popular landmark in the city with the chimes audible around the locality. There was a web version of the clock released in 2004 by the Centre for Development of Imaging Technology (C-Dit), which is offline currently.
