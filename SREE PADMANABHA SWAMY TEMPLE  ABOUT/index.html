				<!-- SREE PADMANABHA SWAMY TEMPLE HISTORY -->
				<article>
					<h2><b>HISTORY</b></h2>
				      <p><b>Several extant Hindu Texts, like the Vishnu Purana, Brahma Purana, Matsya Purana, Varaha Purana, Skanda Purana, Padma Purana, Vayu Purana, Bhagavata Purana. The Temple has been referred to in the (only recorded) Sangam period of literature several times. Many conventional historians and scholars are of the opinion that one of the names that the Temple had, "The Golden Temple", literally was in cognizance of the fact that the Temple was already unimaginably wealthy by that point. Many extant pieces of Sangam Tamil literature and poetry as well as later works of the 9th century of Tamil poet-saints like Nammalwar refer to the temple and the city as having walls of pure gold. At some places, both the temple and the entire city are often eulogised as being made of gold, and the temple as heaven.
The temple is one of the 108 principal DivyaDesams ("Holy Abodes") in Vaishnavism and is glorified in the DivyaPrabandha. The DivyaPrabandha glorifies this shrine as being among the 13 DivyaDesam in Malai Nadu (corresponding to present-day Kerala with Kanyakumari District). The 8th century Tamil poet Alvar Nammalvar sang the glories of Padmanabha. The Ananthapuram temple in Kasaragod is believed to be the original seat of Padmanabhaswamy ("Moolasthanam").
It is believed that Parasurama purified and venerated the idol of Sree Padmanabhaswamy in Dvapara Yuga. Parasurama entrusted 'Kshethrakaryam' (Administration of the Temple) with seven Potti families - KoopakkaraPotti, VanchiyoorAthiyaraPotti, KollurAthiyaraPotti, MuttavilaPotti, KaruvaPotti, NeythasseriPotti and SreekaryathuPotti. King Adithya Vikrama of Vanchi (Venad) was directed by Parasurama to do 'Paripalanam' (Protection) of the Temple. Parasurama gave the Tantram of the Temple to TharananallurNamboothiripad. This legend is narrated in detail in 'Kerala Mahathmyam' which forms part of 'Brahmanda Puranam'.
Another version regarding the consecration of the Main Idol of the Temple relates to the legendary sage VilvamangalathuSwamiyar. Swamiyar, who resided near Ananthapuram Temple in Kasaragod District, prayed to Lord Vishnu for his darshan or "auspicious sight". The Lord is believed to have come in the guise of a little boy who was mischievous. The boy defiled the Idol which was kept for Puja. The sage became enraged at this and chased away the boy who disappeared before him. Realizing the boy was no ordinary mortal, the sage wept for forgiveness and asked for another darshan as a sign. He heard a voice say "If you want to see me come to the Anathavana (the unending forest or ananthakadu). After a long search, when he was walking on the banks of Laccadive Sea, he heard a pulaya lady warning her child that she would throw him in Ananthankadu. The moment the Swami heard the word Ananthankadu he was delighted. He proceeded to Ananthankadu based on the directions of the lady of whom he enquired. The Sage reached Ananthankadu searching for the boy. There he saw the boy merging into an Iluppa tree (Indian Butter Tree). The tree fell down and became AnanthaSayanaMoorti (Vishnu reclining on the celestial snake Anantha). But the edifice that the Lord assumed was of an extraordinarily large size, with His head at Thiruvattar near Thuckalay Tamil Nadu, Body or Udal at Thiruvananthapuram, and lotus-feet at Thrippadapuram near Kulathoor and Technopark (Thrippappur), making him some eight miles in length. The Sage requested the Lord to shrink to a smaller proportion that would be thrice the length of his staff. Immediately the Lord shrank to the form of the Idol that is seen at present in the Temple. But even then many Iluppa trees obstructed a complete vision of the Lord. The Sage saw the Lord in three parts - thirumukham, thiruvudal and thrippadam. Swami prayed to Padmanabha to be forgiven. The Swami offered Rice Kanji and Uppumanga (salted mango pieces) in a coconut shell to the Perumal which he obtained from the pulaya woman. The spot where the Sage had darsan of the Lord belonged to KoopakkaraPotti and KaruvaPotti. With the assistance of the reigning King and some Brahmin households a Temple was constructed. The AnanthankaduNagaraja Temple still exists to the north west of the Padmanabhaswamy Temple. The Samadhi (final resting place) of the Swamiyar exists to the west of the Padmanabhaswamy Temple. A Krishna Temple was built over the Samadhi. This Temple, known as Vilvamangalam Sri Krishna Swami Temple, belongs to Thrissur NaduvilMadhom.
Mukilan, a Muslim marauder, invaded vast chunks of Venad in 1680 AD. He destroyed BudhapuramBhaktadasa Perumal Temple owned by NeythasseriPotti. Mukilan had plans to plunder the vaults of Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple and destroy it. But he was dissuaded from doing so by local Muslims loyal to the Royals of Venad. Padmanabhan Thampi, arch rival of AnizhomThirunalMarthanda Varma, marched to Thiruvananthapuram with his forces and tried to loot the vaults of the Temple. Thampi stayed at Sri Varaham and sent his mercenaries to Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple. It is said that divine serpents materialised in hundreds and scared away Thampi's men. Emboldened by this heavenly intervention, Pallichal Pillai and local people opposed Padmanabhan Thampi and ensured that the mercenaries did not proceed with the misadventure.</b></p>

 <!-- TRAVANCORE ROYAL FAMILY HISTORY -->
<article>
<h2><b>TRAVANCORE ROYAL FAMILY</b></h2>
<p><b>In the first half of the 18th century, in line with matrilineal customs, AnizhamThirunal Marthanda Varma, succeeded his uncle Rama Varma as king at the age of 23. He successfully suppressed the 700-year-old stranglehold of the EttuveetilPillamar ("Lords of the Eight Houses") and his cousins following the discovery of conspiracies which the lords were involved in against the royal house of Travancore (There are various legends and disputes about these mostly apocryphal stories but overall he took control and centralised the rule). The last major renovation of the Padmanabhaswamy temple commenced immediately after AnizhamThirunal's accession to the musnud and the idol was reconsecrated in 906 ME (1731 CE). On 17 January 1750, AnizhamThirunal surrendered the kingdom of Travancore to Padmanabhaswamy, the deity at the temple, and pledged that he and his descendants would be vassals or agents of the deity who would serve the kingdom as PadmanabhaDasa. Since then, the name of every Travancore king was preceded by the title SreePadmanabhaDasa; the female members of the royal family were called SreePadmanabhaSevinis. The donation of the king to Padmanabhaswamy was known as Thrippadi-danam. The final wishes of AnizhamThirunal on his passing at the age of 53 clearly delineated the historical relationship between the Maharaja and the temple: "That no deviation whatsoever should be made in regard to the dedication of the kingdom to Padmanabhaswamy and that all future territorial acquisitions should be made over to the Devaswom."
